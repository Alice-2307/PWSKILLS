        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organize software design around object rather than just function and logic. In OOP we create classes and object to make code more structured, reusable and easy to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - A class in OOP is a blueprint or template to create objects. It defines the attributes and methods that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - An object is an instances of class. When we create a class it acts like a blueprint but nothing is created until we create an object. Each object represents of its own data while sharing the methods defined in the class. In simple words we can say that class is like a design or plan, and objects are the real things built from that plan.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction is the process of hiding comples implementation details and showing only the essential features to the user. It focus on what it does does rather that how is does. When we drive a car just accerlate to speed up without knowing the internal working of the engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and methods togethen into a single unit. It focus on protecting data and restricting direct accsess to it. A bank account class hides the account balance as private data and only provied deposit and withdraw methods to access it.\n",
        "  \n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods also called magic method or special method are built-in menthod in python that start with double underscore and end with double underscore. These method are automatically invoked by python during certain operations like __add__, __str__,__init__ etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - Inheritance in OOp allows a new class or child class to inherit the properties and behavior of an existing class or parent class. Bascially the child class can use the methods and data of the parent class but not vice-versa. It increase the reusability and establishe a relationship between classes\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - The polymosphism is combination of two words Poly means many and mosphism means form. Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take many forms. It allows the same function, method or object to behave differentlty in different situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation is schieved in python using access modifiers public, private and protected.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Public Members: all attributes and methods can be accessed directly access from anywhere even outside the class also.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Protected Members: a single underscore _ before any attributes or method name indicated the protected. It uses internally within the class or its subclass. It also avoid the direct external access\n",
        "\n",
        "    Private Memebrs: A double underscore __ before any atrributes or method name indicated the private and not possible to access directly outside the class and a strong form of protected members\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - A constrcutor in python is a special type of method that is automatically invoked when an object of a class is created. The purpose of constructor is to initialize the atttricutes of the object with default or uder defined value.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Class method is a method that is bound to the class itself. It is defined using the @classmethod. it can access and modify class level variables but can not directly access instance level variables. A static method does not bound to any class or instance. It behaves like a regular function but it is placed inside the class. It is defined using @staticmethod. it cannot access or modift class level or instance level variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Method overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but with different number or types of parameters, so that the correct method is chosen based on the arguments passed. But Python does not support method overloading because if you define multiple method with the same name , only the latest method will be used. But python achieves a similar effect by using default arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - Method overridng in OOP is a mechanism where a child class new implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The method in the clild class must have same name, parameters adn return type as the method in the parent class. In that case when clild class overrides the parent class method and when called, the child classs method is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - property decorator (@property) is a in-built feature that is used to define methods in a class that behave like attributes. It allows you to implement getter, setter and deleter method in a simple way withour calling them like function. Instead of calling a method like obj.get_value(), you can simply access it like an attribute obj.value.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows the same function or method name to work in different ways depending on the object. This makes code more flexible, reusable and easy to maintain. Instead of writing separate function for each type of object we can use one method or fucntion.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An abstract class in pythonn is a class that is designed to act as a blueprint for other classes. It is ensure that all its clild class follow a common structure and implement specific method. for examples: if we have an abstract class shape with an abstract method area(), then all sublasses like circle, rectangle must provide their own version of area().\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - Advantage of OOP are - it makes the code more organized way by dividing code into class or object. It allows reusability of code through inheritance and also improves data security with encapsulation. Polymosphism provides flexibility by letting the same function behave differently in different situation, and abstraction helps in hiding unnecessary details.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  - A class variable is a variable that is shared by all object of a class. it is defined inside the class but outside any method. If its value is changed, the change is reflected across all objects of that class. On the other hand an instance variable bolongs to a specific object. it is usually defined inside the constructor using self. Each object gets its own copy of instances variable, and changing one object instance varibale does not reflect others.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance in python is a mechanism that allows a child class to inherit function and method from more than one parent class. Example: if class C inherits from bith class A and class B than class C use function and method from both class A and class B.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Both __str__ and __repr__ method are dunder methods. The __str__ method is to return a human readable string representation of the ovject. The __repr__ method is to return a string that represent the object is an unambogous and developer oriented way.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "  - The super() function helps a child class use the functionality of its parents class. It allows code resuse and avoid repeating the same logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  -The __del__ method in pyhton is a destructor. Its main significance is that it is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - @staticmethod does not take self or cls as its first parameter. It behaves like a normal function but belongs to the class.\n",
        "  @classmethod takes cls as its first parameter. It can access and modify class level attribiution\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - Polyosphism in pyhton allows the same method name to perform different tasks depending on the object that calls.  With inheritance a base class defines the method  and a child class ovverreide this method.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Method chaining in pyhton OOP refers to the practice of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code. When a method return self, the next method in the chain can ne called directly on the same object\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __call__ method is a dunder method that allows an instanc of a class to be called as if it were a function. __call__ method makes an object callabel. you call a functin by using (), but if a class defned the __call__ method, then its object can also be invoked the same way\n",
